# Twitter Extras

## Version 2.0

Adds support for ultra-wide Twitter. This option removes the sidebar column, which typically contains the *What's Happening* and *Who to Follow* sections. The resulting space is filled by the primary column, creating a considerably wider timeline.

## Version 1.0

Enables extra features on Twitter (e.g. savings videos, and picture-in-picture).
