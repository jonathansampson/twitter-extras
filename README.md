# Twitter Extras

## Version 3.0

Adds support for inline code wrapping. This option will replace portions of Tweets wrapped in a single set of backticks (i.e. the ` character) with code tags. Further, the resulting text will be more easily distinguishable from surrounding text in size, font, and color.

### Version 3.1

Adds support for downloading voice tweets. Click the â€¦ at the top-right of a voice Tweet, and select "Download Voice Tweet" from the menu.

### Version 3.2

Adds support for dynamic timecodes in Tweets with media.

#### Version 3.2.1

Fixed styling issue with dynamic timecode links.

### Version 3.2.2

Adds support for dynamic timecodes posted as an immediate reply to a Tweet with media.

## Version 2.0

Adds support for ultra-wide Twitter. This option removes the sidebar column, which typically contains the *What's Happening* and *Who to Follow* sections. The resulting space is filled by the primary column, creating a considerably wider timeline.

### Version 2.1

Fixed issue where multiple download/pip buttons would be displayed.

### Version 2.2

Removed "ultra-wide" option, replacing instead with options for disabling "What's Happening" and "Who to Follow" components in the sidebar. The ultra-wide option wasn't much of an improvement, in my opinion. In fact, it yielded an even worse experience. Lines of text became considerably longer, media elements (whith a 1x1 ratio, for example) were often much too tall.

## Version 1.0

Enables extra features on Twitter (e.g. savings videos, and picture-in-picture).
